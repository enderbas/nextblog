I'm the part of the team that developed the integration tests for the BMS board of an electric vehicle.

The tests are developed according to the ASIL standard. The tests are developed in C language. The tests are run on the Lauterbach debugger. The tests are run on the Vector CANoe and Vector CANalyzer. The test results are managed on Jama software. The bugs are managed on Jira software. The source code is managed on git.
