Room segmentation is a process of dividing a given space into rooms. This process is used in many applications such as robot navigation, room recognition, and room coverage. 

In this project, I worked on a room segmentation algorithm. I implemented a room segmentation algorithm in C++ and ROS. I used the IPA room segmentation algorithm as a reference. I compared the performances of the IPA room segmentation algorithm and the implemented algorithm. The implemented algorithm has better performance than the IPA room segmentation algorithm. The implemented algorithm has a faster processing duration and a higher accuracy rate. The implemented algorithm is also more robust to noise and occlusions. The implemented algorithm is suitable for real-time applications such as robot navigation and room coverage.
