Qt for MCUs offers a lightweight graphics framework and toolkit that enables you to design, develop, and deploy graphical user interfaces (GUI) on microcontrollers (MCU). It lets you run the application either on bare metal or a real-time operating systems.

I use Qt for MCUs when first released to develop a GUI application for an STM32F746 microcontroller. I use C++ and Qt for MCUs to develop the application. I use CMake to build the application. I use Git for version control.
