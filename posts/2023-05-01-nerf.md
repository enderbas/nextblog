NERF repository is a collection of papers and codes about Neural Radiance Fields. It's a new method for 3D scene representation and rendering. It's a hot topic in computer graphics and computer vision. It's a new way to represent 3D scenes and objects. It's a new way to render.

I applied this method to my project. I used a pre-trained model for this. I used a python for testing and processing. I used a Nvidia GPU for this. I used a git for version control.
